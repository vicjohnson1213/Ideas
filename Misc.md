# Miscellaneous

Software projects that don't really have any optimal platform, but I think would be interesting tow write or use.

### Conway's Game of Life

A popular generation simulation. This could potentially be really cool on an LED oard powered by an Arduino or something.

### Image Pixelator

- Limit the number of possible in each band (R,G,B).
- Pull the nearest color from an existing color palette.

*In Progress:* https://github.com/vicjohnson1213/Pxl

### Markdown Based Slideshow Creator

- Use markdown to provide the content of a slideshow.
- Use CSS to layout and style the slides.
- Output the slideshow as a website so it can run in any browser?

### Mutation/Evolution Simulation

Given a set of rules and probabilities, each generation may or may not mutate. It could be interesting to see how different mutations become prominent given different measurements for success.

### Sudoku Solver

A program to solve sudoku puzzles.

### *The Witness* Puzzle Solver

- Return all possible solutions to a puzzle.
