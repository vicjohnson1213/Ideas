# Games

Games that I think would either be fun to code or fun to play (hopefully both).

### Consciousness

A game where you can transfer your consciousness between bodies in order to solve puzzles or get out of touch positions.

### Cypher

A game where a player is given a "cypher" and has to decode what the original message was.

- Replace letters with numbers, colors, or symbol.
- Could display letter probabilities as a hint.
- Hard mode with replacements for common combinations of letters (e.g. "ch", "th").
